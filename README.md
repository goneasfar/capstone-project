# capstone-project
This will have to do with my breakout game for my capstone project

I am still learning all of the things that go along with Github, Git, and project development. 

Some java classes need to be deleted later on. Keeping most everything for now in case I need it later. 

It still needs some work on making everything run smoothly. Coming along smoothly.
