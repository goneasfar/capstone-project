# capstone-project
This will have to do with my breakout game for my capstone project

I am still learning all of the things that go along with Github, Git, and project development. 

Some java classes need to be deleted later on. Keeping most everything for now in case I need it later. 

It still needs some work on making everything run smoothly. Coming along smoothly.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I have added all the levels that will exist in the game. There isn't a strong OOP approach to this, but it's not very necessary for the context of the game.
If I want to continue this game, I will need to make classes for a lot of the resources use. Below will be the listed objects I am thinking of 
implementing now:
-	Ball
-	Powerup
-	Paddle/Racket
-	Screen (maybe...could have certain screens be funcitons within a class)
		Possible just make a game class that contains all gameplay.
		Some of the things that don't necessarily deserve a class but have similarities to other things can
		be placed under a blanket function. Not sure how appropriate something like that really is. 
		Something like that could mess up ordering some things later on...
		
One of the functionalities I would like to add is having the game have the ability to go on forever. I have create a "secret" level and I would
like it if you didn't die. The way to exit would be pausing it and clicking a button to quit? Not sure. 
This functionality would tie into when you win a level. I would like the ball to bounce around with the buttons displayed. You could stil hit
the ball until you click a button. The speed of the ball would be a lot higher than it is now. This would go along with the secret level as well.
